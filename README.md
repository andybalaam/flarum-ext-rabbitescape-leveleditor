# Flarum extension to include the Rabbit Escape Level Editor

This is an extension to the [Flarum](https://flarum.org/) forum to include the
[level editor](https://github.com/andybalaam/rabbit-escape-level-editor) for
the Android+PC game
[Rabbit Escape](http://artificialworlds.net/rabbit-escape/).

We use the minimal amount of Flarum to insert some JavaScript into the
environment, meaning we can avoid any compile step.

## How to create levels

## Where to log issues

When you find a problem in the level editor forum it's difficult to tell whether it's a bug in the Flarum integration (this repo) or in the level editor code (which is at https://github.com/andybalaam/rabbit-escape-level-editor).  To keep it simple:

**Log all issues in the Level Editor repo at https://github.com/andybalaam/rabbit-escape-level-editor/issues**
